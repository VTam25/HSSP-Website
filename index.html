          <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>

          <p> 
            Welcome to my website! My name is Vivienne Tam and I'm a recently graduated senior from Winchester High School.
            I will be attending college this fall at UMass Amherst, studying computer science. 
            Some of my hobbies include photography, bullet journaling, listening to music, and dancing.
            I also enjoy trying out new foods with friends (although not now of course), watching anime, and playing Animal Crossing.
